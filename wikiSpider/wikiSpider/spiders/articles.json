Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation . [ 33 ] Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected . It supports multiple programming paradigms , including structured (particularly procedural ), object-oriented and functional programming . It is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library . [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language, and he first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. [ 36 ] Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2. [ 37 ] Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages, and it has gained widespread use in the machine learning community. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] Python was conceived in the late 1980s [ 42 ] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands ; it was conceived as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL , [ 43 ] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. [ 12 ] Python implementation began in December 1989. [ 44 ] Van Rossum assumed sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from responsibilities as Python's \" benevolent dictator for life \" (BDFL); this title was bestowed on him by the Python community to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.", "lastUpdated": " This page was last edited on 5 May 2025, at 00:14"},

Yoko Shimomura (pictured) composed the game's music. A direct sequel to Kingdom Hearts , it uses a new card-based battle system rather than its predecessor's real-time combat. The story follows Sora and his friends as they explore the Castle Oblivion while battling Organization XIII. It received positive reviews for its story, graphics and full-motion videos , but its battle system was criticized. It was remade for the PlayStation 2 as Kingdom Hearts Re: Chain of Memories and packaged with Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix . It was then remastered in high definition and included in the Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix collection, which was released in 2013 for the PlayStation 3 , and later for the PlayStation 4 , the Xbox One , and personal computers .

They were produced in response to silver agitation by citizens who were angered by the Coinage Act of 1873 , which had effectively placed the United States on a gold standard . Since 1968 they have been redeemable only in Federal Reserve Notes and are thus obsolete, but they remain legal tender at their face value and hence are still an accepted form of currency.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm", "title": "Programming paradigm", "text": "A programming paradigm is a relatively high-level way to conceptualize and structure the implementation of a computer program . A programming language can be classified as supporting one or more paradigms. [ 1 ] Paradigms are separated along and described by different dimensions of programming. Some paradigms are about implications of the execution model , such as allowing side effects , or whether the sequence of operations is defined by the execution model. Other paradigms are about the way code is organized, such as grouping into units that include both state and behavior. Yet others are about syntax and grammar . Some common programming paradigms include (shown in hierarchical relationship ): [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Programming paradigms come from computer science research into existing practices of software development . The findings allow for describing and comparing programming practices and the languages used to code programs. For perspective, other fields of research study software engineering processes and describe various methodologies to describe and compare them. A programming language can be described in terms of paradigms. Some languages support only one paradigm. For example, Smalltalk supports object-oriented and Haskell supports functional. Most languages support multiple paradigms. For example, a program written in C++ , Object Pascal , or PHP can be purely procedural , purely object-oriented , or can contain aspects of both paradigms, or others. When using a language that supports multiple paradigms, the developer chooses which paradigm elements to use. But, this choice may not involve considering paradigms per se. The developer often uses the features of a language as the language provides them and to the extent that the developer knows them. Categorizing the resulting code by paradigm is often an academic activity done in retrospect. Languages categorized as imperative paradigm have two main features: they state the order in which operations occur, with constructs that explicitly control that order, and they allow side effects, in which state can be modified at one point in time, within one unit of code, and then later read at a different point in time inside a different unit of code.  The communication between the units of code is not explicit. In contrast, languages in the declarative paradigm do not state the order in which to execute operations. Instead, they supply a number of available operations in the system, along with the conditions under which each is allowed to execute. [ 7 ] The implementation of the language's execution model tracks which operations are free to execute and chooses the order independently. More at Comparison of multi-paradigm programming languages . In object-oriented programming, code is organized into objects that contain state that is owned by and (usually) controlled by the code of the object.  Most object-oriented languages are also imperative languages. In object-oriented programming, programs are treated as a set of interacting objects. In functional programming , programs are treated as a sequence of stateless function evaluations. When programming computers or systems with many processors, in process-oriented programming , programs are treated as sets of concurrent processes that act on a logical shared data structures . Many programming paradigms are as well known for the techniques they forbid as for those they support . For instance, pure functional programming disallows side-effects , while structured programming disallows the goto", "lastUpdated": " This page was last edited on 28 April 2025, at 09:16"},
