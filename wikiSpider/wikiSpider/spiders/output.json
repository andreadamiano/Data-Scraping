The phrase originated in 1995 with reference to Guido van Rossum , creator of the Python programming language . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Shortly after Van Rossum joined the Corporation for National Research Initiatives , the term appeared in a follow-up mail by Ken Manheimer to a meeting trying to create a semi-formal group that would oversee Python development and workshops; this initial use included an additional joke of naming Van Rossum the \"First Interim BDFL\". According to Rossum, the title was most likely created by Ken Manheimer or Barry Warsaw . [ 1 ] In July 2018, Van Rossum announced that he would be stepping down as BDFL of Python without appointing a successor, effectively eliminating the title within the Python community structure. [ 3 ] BDFL should not be confused with the more common term for open-source leaders, \"benevolent dictator\", which was popularized by Eric S. Raymond 's essay \" Homesteading the Noosphere \" (1999). [ 4 ] Among other topics related to hacker culture , Raymond elaborates on how the nature of open source forces the \"dictatorship\" to keep itself benevolent, since a strong disagreement can lead to the forking of the project under the rule of new leaders.

After various theatre roles in Ireland, England and the United States as well as acting on radio shows, Welles began directing stage productions for the Federal Theatre Project at the age of 21. These included the Voodoo Macbeth (1936) and The Cradle Will Rock (1937). His first film was Citizen Kane (1941), which he co-wrote , produced, directed and starred in as the title character, Charles Foster Kane . It has been consistently ranked as one of the greatest films ever made . Welles directed twelve other features, including The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), The Lady from Shanghai (1947), Othello (1951), Touch of Evil (1958), The Trial (1962), Chimes at Midnight (1966), and F for Fake (1973). Welles's distinctive directorial style featured layered and nonlinear narrative forms, dramatic lighting, unusual camera angles, sound techniques borrowed from radio, deep focus shots and long takes . He received an Academy Award and three Grammy Awards , among other honors. This photograph, taken in 1938, shows Welles surrounded by reporters and discussing his radio drama \" The War of the Worlds \", which had induced panic among some listeners who believed that a real Martian invasion was taking place.

La traducción de Benevolent Dictator for Life es Dictador Benevolente De por vida , lo que conlleva un tanto de informalidad [ b ] ​ y humor . En 1995 Guido van Rossum , creador de Python , fue la primera persona sobre la que recayó dicha distinción. [ 1 ] ​ [ 2 ] ​ El término \"Benevolent Dictator for Life\" fue acuñado por el programador de Python , Guido van Rossum , quien se autodesignó como \"BDFL\" para el desarrollo de Python. En la comunidad del software libre , el papel del BDFL es visto como una forma efectiva de tomar decisiones rápidas y unificadas, lo que permite que un proyecto crezca y evolucione de manera más eficiente . Sin embargo, también hay críticas al concepto de BDFL, ya que algunas personas argumentan que el control absoluto de una sola persona puede limitar la creatividad y la innovación del proyecto. Además, la naturaleza del BDFL puede crear una dependencia insalubre en una sola persona , lo que puede ser perjudicial para el proyecto a largo plazo . Nótese la diferencia con su significado histórico usado en un contexto político . [ cita requerida ] Entendemos por dictador benevolente aquella persona que tiene la autoridad final para la toma de decisiones, por su personalidad o experiencia y la aplica diariamente con un uso racional para el beneficio de una comunidad o de una familia en concreto. No hay que asociar este concepto al tópico de dictador que toma las decisiones por la fuerza o sin consenso común. Los dictadores benevolentes no toman realmente las decisiones, dejan que las cosas fluyan libremente, esperan un intercambio de ideas, y mediante la experiencia, el razonamiento y la reflexión intentan llegar a un acuerdo. En caso de que no se consiga, el dictador benevolente cuenta con suficiente experiencia para poder tomar una decisión final que beneficiará a la sociedad. [ 16 ] ​ Por otro lado, en muchos casos el dictador tendrá que delegar responsabilidad en la toma de decisiones en quien considere que esté capacitado para ejecutarlo. Una de las características que les une a los dictadores, es su rechazo en la toma de decisiones sin ser consensuada y entendida por todos los miembros de la sociedad, a lo que suelen decir “así tiene que ser”, en el sentido de que es lo mejor para ti y para la sociedad porque ya lo he conocido a través de la experiencia. Ser dictador benevolente requiere una especial delicadeza a la hora de dirigirse a la comunidad. En primer lugar, cuando comienza la conversación, el dictador permite que los individuos de la sociedad manifiesten sus opiniones libremente, dejando para el final sus opiniones constructivas para que los miembros de la comunidad no se sientan influenciados. Aunque en algunos casos, el dictador puede equivocarse, pero no por ello pierde su credibilidad. Es importante que el dictador sea el emprendedor del proyecto. Que reúna las habilidades, tales como competencia técnica o habilidad de persuadir para poder liderar el proyecto y que los miembros de la sociedad confíen en tus ideas. Así el proyecto será centralizado ya que sus conocimientos y aptitudes son aceptadas por el grupo. Pero en cambio si no hay un candidato con suficiente credibilidad, es mejor que el proyecto se descentralice en la toma de decisiones.", "lastUpdated": " Esta página se editó por última vez el 11 nov 2024 a las 14:09."},

[ a ] [ b ] Publishers purchase or receive ISBNs from an affiliate of the International ISBN Agency. [ 2 ] A different ISBN is assigned to each separate edition and variation of a publication, but not to a simple reprinting of an existing item. For example, an e-book , a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book must each have a different ISBN, but an unchanged reprint of the hardcover edition keeps the same ISBN. The ISBN is ten digits long if assigned before 2007, and thirteen digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007. [ c ] The method of assigning an ISBN is nation-specific and varies between countries, often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country. The first version of the ISBN identification format was devised in 1967, based upon the 9-digit Standard Book Numbering ( SBN ) created in 1966. The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108 (any 9-digit SBN can be converted to a 10-digit ISBN by prefixing it with a zero). Privately published books sometimes appear without an ISBN. The International ISBN Agency sometimes assigns ISBNs to such books on its own initiative. [ 4 ] A separate identifier code of a similar kind, the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN), identifies periodical publications such as magazines and newspapers . The International Standard Music Number (ISMN) covers musical scores . The Standard Book Number (SBN) is a commercial system using nine-digit code numbers to identify books. In 1965, British bookseller and stationers WHSmith announced plans to implement a standard numbering system for its books. [ 1 ] They hired consultants to work on their behalf, and the system was devised by Gordon Foster , emeritus professor of statistics at Trinity College Dublin . [ 5 ] The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Technical Committee on Documentation sought to adapt the British SBN for international use.

[ 2 ] In addition, the degree of participation could range from zero to 100% in different participative management (PM) stages. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] PDM is one of many ways in which an organization can make decisions. The leader must think of the best possible way that will allow the organization to achieve the best results. According to Abraham Maslow , workers need to feel a sense of belonging to an organization (see Maslow's hierarchy of needs ). [ citation needed ] \" Participative management (PM) is known by many names including shared leadership , employee empowerment, employee involvement, participative decision-making, dispersed leadership, open-book management, or industrial democracy \". [ 4 ] \"The basic concept involves any power-sharing arrangement in which workplace influence is shared among individuals who are otherwise hierarchical unequals. Such power-sharing arrangements may entail various employee involvement schemes resulting in co-determination of working conditions, problem solving, and decision-making\". [ 5 ] The primary aim of PDM is for the organization to benefit from the \"perceived motivational effects of increased employee involvement\" [ 6 ] PM is important where a large number of stakeholders are involved from different walks of life, coming together to make a decision which may benefit everyone. Some examples are decisions for the environment, health care , anti-animal cruelty and other similar situations. In this case, everyone can be involved, from experts, NGOs , government agencies, to volunteers and members of public. However, organizations may benefit from the perceived motivational influences of employees. When employees participate in the decision-making process, they may improve understanding and perceptions among colleagues and superiors, and enhance personnel value in the organization. Participatory decision-making by the top management team can ensure the completeness of decision-making and may increase team member commitment to final decisions. In a participative decision-making process each team member has an opportunity to share their perspectives, voice their ideas and tap their skills to improve team effectiveness and efficiency . Participatory decision-making can have a wide array of organizational benefits. Researchers have found that PDM may positively impact the following: By sharing decision-making with other employees, participants may eventually achieve organization objectives that influence them. [ 7 ] In this process, PDM can be used as a tool that may enhance relationships in the organization, increase employee work incentives , and increase the rate of information circulation across the organization [ 8 ] The outcomes are various in PDM. In the aspect of employees, PDM refers to job satisfaction and performance , which are usually recognized as commitment and productivity [ 9 ] In the aspect of employers, PDM is evolved into decision quality and efficiency that influenced by multiple and differential mixed layers in terms of information access , level of participation, processes and dimensions in PDM.

The foundation has since evolved to promote open-source projects beyond the Linux OS as a \"foundation of foundations\" that hosts a variety of projects spanning topics such as cloud , networking, blockchain , and hardware. [ 4 ] The foundation also hosts annual educational events among the Linux community, including the Linux Kernel Developers Summit and the Open Source Summit . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] As of September 2015 [update] , the total economic value of the development costs of Linux Foundation Collaborative Projects was estimated at $5 billion. [ 7 ] For the Linux kernel community, the Linux Foundation hosts its IT infrastructure and organizes conferences such as the Linux Kernel Summit and the Linux Plumbers Conference. It also hosts a Technical Advisory Board made up of Linux kernel developers. One of these developers has been appointed to sit on the Linux Foundation board. In January 2016, the Linux Foundation announced a partnership with Goodwill Central Texas to help hundreds of disadvantaged individuals from underserved communities and a variety of backgrounds get the training they need to start careers in Linux IT. [ 37 ] In July 2020, the Linux Foundation announced an initiative allowing open-source communities to create Open Standards using tools and methods inspired by open-source developers. [ 38 ] The Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII), is a project managed by the Linux Foundation that enables technology companies, industry stakeholders, and esteemed developers to collaboratively identify and fund critical open-source projects in need of assistance. In June 2015, the organization announced financial support of nearly $500,000 for three new projects to better support critical security elements of the global information infrastructure. [ 39 ] In May 2016, CII launched its Best Practice Badge program to raise awareness of development processes and project governance steps that will help projects have better security outcomes. In May 2017, CII issued its 100th badge to a passing project. [ 40 ] Introduced in October 2017, [ 41 ] the Community Data License Agreement (CDLA) is a legal framework for sharing data.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition", "title": "Spaced repetition", "text": "Spaced repetition is an evidence-based learning technique that is usually performed with flashcards . Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently, while older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect . The use of spaced repetition has been proven to increase the rate of learning. [ 1 ] Although the principle is useful in many contexts, spaced repetition is commonly applied in contexts in which a learner must acquire many items and retain them indefinitely in memory. It is, therefore, well suited for the problem of vocabulary acquisition in the course of second-language learning. A number of spaced repetition software programs have been developed to aid the learning process. It is also possible to perform spaced repetition with physical flashcards using the Leitner system . The testing effect and spaced repetition can be combined to improve long-term memory. Therefore, memorization can be easier to do. The method of spaced repetition was first conceived of in the 1880s by German scientist Hermann Ebbinghaus . Ebbinghaus created the 'forgetting curve' - a graph portraying the loss of learned information over time -  and postulated that it can be curbed by reviewing such information at several intervals over a period of time. [ 2 ] It was also tested by Thomas Landauer and Robert A. Bjork in 1978; they gathered a group of psychology students, showing the students pictures of a certain individual followed by that individual's name. This is also known as a face-name association. With the repetition of seeing the person's name and face they were able to associate the name and face of that individual shown with the expansion of time due to the spaced repetition. [ 3 ] Schacter, Rich, and Stampp in 1985 expanded the research to include people who have amnesia and other memory disorders. The findings showed that using spaced repetition can not only help students with name face association but patients dealing with memory impairments. [ 4 ] In 1989, C. J. Camp decided that using this technique with Alzheimer's patients may increase their duration of remembering particular things. [ 3 ] These results show that the expansion of the time interval shows the strongest benefits for memory. [ 4 ] Spaced repetition is a method where the subject is asked to remember a certain fact with the time intervals increasing each time the fact is presented or said. If the subject is able to recall the information correctly the time is doubled to further help them keep the information fresh in their mind to recall in the future. With this method, the patient is able to place the information in their long-term memory. If they are unable to remember the information they go back to the previous step and continue to practice to help make the technique lasting (Vance & Farr, 2007). [ 5 ] The expansion is done to ensure a high success level of recalling the information on the first time and increasing the time interval to make the information long-lasting to help keep the information always accessible in their mind. [ 6 ] Throughout the development of spaced repetition, they have found that patients using this technique with dementia are able to recall the information weeks—even months—later. The technique has been successful in helping dementia patients remember particular objects' names, daily tasks, name face association, information about themselves, and many other facts and behaviors (Small, 2012). [ 7 ] Sufficient test evidence shows that spaced repetition is valuable in learning new information and recalling information from the past. [ 4 ] Small combines the works and findings of quite a few scientists to come up with five reasons why spaced repetition works: it helps show the relationship of routine memories, it shows the benefits of learning things with an expansion of time, it helps the patient with Alzheimer's dementia keep their brain active, it has a high success level with little to no errors, and the technique is meaningful for the patient to do and remember more thing) [ 7 ] Joltin et al. (2003), [ 8 ] had a caregiver train a woman with Alzheimer's by giving her the name of her grandchild over the phone while asking her to associate with the picture of the grandchild posted on the refrigerator. After training, the woman was able to recall the name of her grandchild five days later. [ 4 ] The notion that spaced repetition could be used for improving learning was first proposed in the book Psychology of Study by C. A. Mace in 1932: \"Perhaps the most important discoveries are those which relate to the appropriate distribution of the periods of study... Acts of revision should be spaced in gradually increasing intervals, roughly intervals of one day, two days, four days, eight days, and so on.\" [ 9 ] In 1939, H. F. Spitzer tested the effects of a type of spaced repetition on sixth-grade students in Iowa who were learning science facts.

Andrei Alexandrescu joined the design and development effort in 2007. Though it originated as a re-engineering of C++ , D is now a very different language. As it has developed, it has drawn inspiration from other high-level programming languages . Notably, it has been influenced by Java , Python , Ruby , C# , and Eiffel . The D language reference describes it as follows: D is a general-purpose systems programming language with a C-like syntax that compiles to native code. It is statically typed and supports both automatic (garbage collected) and manual memory management. D programs are structured as modules that can be compiled separately and linked with external libraries to create native libraries or executables. [ 11 ] D is not source-compatible with C and C++ source code in general. However, any code that is legal in both C/C++ and D should behave in the same way. Like C++, D has closures , anonymous functions , compile-time function execution , design by contract , ranges, built-in container iteration concepts, and type inference . D's declaration, statement and expression syntaxes also closely match those of C++. Unlike C++, D also implements garbage collection , first class arrays ( std::array in C++ are technically not first class), array slicing , nested functions and lazy evaluation . D uses Java-style single inheritance with interfaces and mixins rather than C++-style multiple inheritance . D is a systems programming language. Like C++, and unlike application languages such as Java and C# , D supports low-level programming , including inline assembler . Inline assembler allows programmers to enter machine-specific assembly code within standard D code. System programmers use this method to access the low-level features of the processor that are needed to run programs that interface directly with the underlying hardware , such as operating systems and device drivers . Low-level programming is also used to write higher performance code than would be produced by a compiler .", "lastUpdated": " This page was last edited on 28 April 2025, at 17:58"},

It uses techniques from cognitive science such as active recall testing and spaced repetition to aid the user in memorization. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The name comes from the Japanese word for \"memorization\" ( 暗記 ). [ 6 ] The SM-2 algorithm , created for SuperMemo in the late 1980s, has historically formed the basis of the spaced repetition methods employed in the program. Anki's implementation of the algorithm has been modified to allow priorities on cards and to show flashcards in order of their urgency. Anki 23.10+ also has a native implementation of the Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler (FSRS) algorithm, which allows for more optimal spacing of card repetitions. [ 7 ] Anki is content-agnostic , and the cards are presented using HTML and may include text, images, sounds, videos, [ 8 ] and LaTeX equations. The decks of cards, along with the user's statistics, are stored in the open SQLite format. Cards are generated from information stored as \"notes\". Notes are analogous to database entries and can have an arbitrary number of fields. For example, with respect to learning a language, a note may have the following fields and example entries: This example illustrates what some programs call a three-sided flashcard , but Anki's model is more general and allows any number of fields to be combined in various cards. The user can design cards that test the information contained in each note. One card may have a question (expression) and an answer (pronunciation, meaning). By keeping the separate cards linked to the same fact, spelling mistakes can be adjusted against all cards at the same time, and Anki can ensure that related cards are not shown in too short a spacing. A special note type allows the generation of cloze deletion cards. In Anki 1.2.x, those were ordinary cards with cloze markup added using a tool in the fact editor. Anki supports synchronization with a free and proprietary online service called AnkiWeb.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent", "title": "BitTorrent", "text": "BitTorrent is a communication protocol for peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P), which enables users to distribute data and electronic files over the Internet in a decentralized manner. The protocol is developed and maintained by Rainberry, Inc. , and was first released in 2001. [ 2 ] To send or receive files, users use a BitTorrent client on their Internet-connected computer, which are available for a variety of computing platforms and operating systems , including an official client . BitTorrent trackers provide a list of files available for transfer and allow the client to find peer users, known as \"seeds\", who may transfer the files. BitTorrent downloading is considered to be faster than HTTP (\"direct downloading\") and FTP due to the lack of a central server that could limit bandwidth. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] BitTorrent is one of the most common protocols for transferring large files, such as digital video files containing TV shows and video clips, or digital audio files. BitTorrent accounted for a third of all internet traffic in 2004, according to a study by Cachelogic. [ 5 ] As recently as 2019 BitTorrent remained a significant file sharing protocol according to Sandvine , generating a substantial amount of Internet traffic, with 2.46% of downstream , and 27.58% of upstream traffic, [ 6 ] although this share has declined significantly since then. [ 7 ] Programmer Bram Cohen , a University at Buffalo alumnus, [ 8 ] designed the protocol in April 2001 with the idea of speeding up download time by enabling files to be downloaded from many sources. He then released the first available version on 2 July 2001. [ 2 ] Cohen and Ashwin Navin founded BitTorrent, Inc. (later renamed Rainberry, Inc. ) to further develop the technology in 2004. The first release of the BitTorrent client had no search engine and no peer exchange. Up until 2005, the only way to share files was by creating a small text file called a \" torrent \", that they would upload to a torrent index site. The first uploader acted as a seed , and downloaders would initially connect as peers . Those who wish to download the file would download the torrent, which their client would use to connect to a tracker which had a list of the IP addresses of other seeds and peers in the swarm. Once a peer completed a download of the complete file, it could in turn function as a seed. These files contain metadata about the files to be shared and the trackers which keep track of the other seeds and peers. In 2005, first Vuze and then the BitTorrent client introduced distributed tracking using distributed hash tables which allowed clients to exchange data on swarms directly without the need for a torrent file. In 2006, peer exchange functionality was added allowing clients to add peers based on the data found on connected nodes. In 2017, BitTorrent, Inc. released the BitTorrent v2 protocol specification.

He is also the co-founder of CodeCon and organizer of the San Francisco Bay Area P2P-hackers meeting, was the co-author of Codeville and creator of the Chia cryptocurrency which implements the proof of space-time consensus algorithm . Cohen grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City, as the son of a teacher and computer scientist. He claims he learned the BASIC programming language at the age of 5 on his family's Timex Sinclair computer. Cohen passed the American Invitational Mathematics Examination to qualify for the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad while he attended Stuyvesant High School in New York City. He graduated from Stuyvesant in 1993, [ 1 ] and attended SUNY Buffalo . He later dropped out of college to work for several dot-com companies throughout the mid-to-late 1990s, the last being MojoNation, an ambitious but ill-fated project he worked on with Jim McCoy. MojoNation allowed people to break up confidential files into encrypted chunks and distribute those pieces on computers also running the software. If someone wanted to download a copy of this encrypted file, they would have to download it simultaneously from many computers. This concept, Cohen thought, was perfect for a file-sharing program, since programs like KaZaA take a long time to download a large file because the file is (usually) coming from one source (or peer ). In April 2001, Cohen quit MojoNation and began work on BitTorrent. Cohen designed BitTorrent to be able to download files from many sources, thus speeding up the download time, especially for users with faster download than upload speeds. Thus, the more popular a file is, the faster a user will be able to download it, since many people will be downloading it at the same time, and these people will also be uploading the data to other users. Cohen unveiled his ideas at the first CodeCon conference, which he and his roommate Len Sassaman created as a showcase event for novel technology projects after becoming disillusioned with the state of then-current technology conferences. Cohen wrote the first BitTorrent client implementation in Python . In the summer of 2002, Cohen collected free pornography to lure beta testers to use the program. [ 2 ] In May 2005, Cohen released a trackerless beta version of BitTorrent. BitTorrent gained its fame for its ability to quickly share large music and movie files online. Since the early releases, many other programs have implemented the BitTorrent protocol. Cohen has claimed he has never violated copyright law using his software. [ 2 ] Regardless, he is outspoken in his belief that the traditional media business model is doomed to becoming outmoded, despite RIAA 's and MPAA 's legal and technical tactics, such as digital rights management . In late 2003, Cohen worked for a short time at Valve , working on Steam , their digital distribution system introduced for Half-Life 2 .

It is a stand-alone library, not part of any framework. RedBeanPHP is an on-the-fly object–relational mapper, this means there is no upfront configuration. The system relies on conventions entirely and adapts the database schema to fit the needs of the program. This way, it strikes a balance between NoSQL and traditional RDBMS solutions. RedBeanPHP is different from other ORM systems because it requires no configuration in XML , YAML or JSON . It adapts the database schema based on the needs of the program. All tables and columns are created on-the-fly, without upfront configuration or mapping. It automatically adds columns to tables if necessary and changes the type of the column to match its content requirements. When the developer is done developing and no more schema changes are expected, the schema can be frozen for deployment to production environments. After freezing the database no more schema alterations take place. Relations among tables are mapped in the same way: by convention. For instance, to create a one-to-many relationship between two tables one assigns an array to the property bearing the name of the target table. This automatically creates the table as well as the required columns. Code example, demonstrating a simple CRUD operation and a relation: RedBeanPHP is the first library known to adopt the on-the-fly approach towards ORM.

An initial core version of the compiler (the bootstrap compiler ) is generated in a different language (which could be assembly language); successive expanded versions of the compiler are developed using this minimal subset of the language. The problem of compiling a self-compiling compiler has been called the chicken-or-egg problem in compiler design, and bootstrapping is a solution to this problem. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Bootstrapping is a fairly common practice when creating a programming language . Many compilers for many programming languages are bootstrapped, including compilers for ALGOL , BASIC , C , Common Lisp , D , Eiffel , Elixir , Go , Haskell , Java , Modula-2 , Nim , Oberon , OCaml , Pascal , PL/I , Python , Rust , Scala , Scheme , TypeScript , Vala , Zig and more. A typical bootstrap process works in three or four stages: [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The full compiler is built twice in order to compare the outputs of the two stages. If they are different, either the bootstrap or the full compiler contains a bug. [ 3 ] Bootstrapping a compiler has the following advantages: [ 6 ] Note that some of these points assume that the language runtime is also written in the same language. If one needs to compile a compiler for language X written in language X, there is the issue of how the first compiler can be compiled.

Many computer industry standards, especially those developed and submitted by industry consortiums or individual companies, involve royalties for the actual implementation of these standards. These royalties are typically charged on a \"per port\"/\"per device\" basis, where the manufacturer of end-user devices has to pay a small fixed fee for each device sold, and also include a substantial annual fixed fee. With millions of devices sold each year, the royalties can amount to several millions of dollars, which is a significant burden for the manufacturer. Examples of such royalties-based standards include IEEE 1394, HDMI , and H.264/ MPEG -4 AVC. Royalty-free standards do not include any \"per-port\" or \"per-volume\" charges or annual payments for the actual implementation of the standard, even though the text of the actual specification is typically protected by copyright and needs to be purchased from the standards body. Most open standards are royalty-free, and many proprietary standards are royalty-free as well. Examples of royalty-free standards include DisplayPort , VGA , VP8 , and Matroska . In photography and the illustration industry, it refers to a copyright license where the user has the right to use the picture without many restrictions to the licensor. The user can therefore use the image in several projects without having to purchase any additional licenses. RF licenses can not be given on an exclusive basis. In stock photography , RF is one of the common licenses sometimes contrasted with Rights Managed licenses and often employed in subscription-based or microstock photography business models.

Some digital cameras give access to almost all the data captured by the camera, using a raw image format . The Universal Photographic Imaging Guidelines (UPDIG) suggests these formats be used when possible since raw files produce the best quality images. These file formats allow the photographer and the processing agent the greatest level of control and accuracy for output. Their use is inhibited by the prevalence of proprietary information ( trade secrets ) for some camera makers, but there have been initiatives such as OpenRAW to influence manufacturers to release these records publicly. An alternative may be Digital Negative (DNG) , a proprietary Adobe product described as \"the public, archival format for digital camera raw data\". [ 2 ] Although this format is not yet universally accepted, support for the product is growing, and increasingly professional archivists and conservationists, working for respectable organizations, variously suggest or recommend DNG for archival purposes.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_intersection", "title": "Protected intersection", "text": "A protected intersection or protected junction , also known as a Dutch-style junction , is a type of at-grade road junction in which cyclists and pedestrians are separated from cars. The primary aim of junction protection is to help pedestrians and cyclists be and feel safer at road junctions. [ 1 ] At a conventional junction, pedestrians are separated from motor vehicles, while cyclists are placed in the carriageway with motorists. Cycle lanes are often placed on the nearside (right in right-side driving countries ; left in left-side countries) of the carriageway, which can create conflict, for example when a cyclist is going straight ahead and a motorist is turning to the nearside. [ 1 ] At a protected junction, vehicles turning to the nearside are separated from crossing cyclists and pedestrians by a buffer, providing increased reaction times and visibility.  Drivers looking to turn to the nearside have better visibility of cyclists and pedestrians as they can look to the side for conflicts instead of over their shoulders. At unsignalised intersections, it is practice to have one car length of space between the cycleway and roadway, so that cars exiting the minor street have an area to pull forward and wait for a gap in traffic, without becoming distracted by potential simultaneous conflicts along the cyclepath. This type of intersection has for decades been used in the bicycle-friendly Netherlands , and Denmark . An alternative philosophy, design for vehicular cycling , encourages having bicycle lanes simply disappear, or \"drop\", at intersections, forcing riders to merge into traffic like a vehicle operator ahead of the intersection in order to avoid the risk of a right-hook collision, when a right turning motorist collides with a through moving cyclist. Design policies which do not allow the cyclist to remain separated through the intersection have come under increasing scrutiny in recent years as causing difficulties for less capable riders, [ 2 ] leading to lower overall ridership and sidewalk riding, [ 3 ] [ 4 ] and being less safe. [ 5 ] With the popularity of the bicycle, the Dutch began constructing separated cycle tracks as early as the late 1800s. [ 6 ] The country's infrastructure was left in ruins by World War II , and some cities like Rotterdam had to be completely rebuilt. [ 7 ] This presented the opportunity to create infrastructure more in line with the \"modern\" way. From the 1940s to the 70s, streets were built following a new design philosophy that attempted to integrate cyclists with vehicle traffic. [ 8 ] After three decades, these designs proved to be largely a failure, with the number of kilometers cycled falling by 65% and the per-km rate of cyclists being killed increasing 174%. [ 9 ] In the 1970s, road traffic and urban quality of life began to be seen as a significant issue in Dutch city politics. This, combined with other political headwinds related to party reorganisation, the decline of national religious pillars , and opposition to the Vietnam War propelled left wing political parties to office in many city governments. [ 10 ] Stop De Kindermoord road safety protests also occurred. As the nation again began to desire separated bicycle infrastructure, the protected intersection rose to prominence as an engineering solution for optimizing sightlines. It joined other Dutch innovations in traffic calming and bicycle design, like the woonerf , and the bicycle street (fietsstraat), a variant of which exists in North America (see bicycle boulevard ). Today, the Netherlands is widely considered the world's premier country for cycling, with more than 25% of all trips made by bicycle. [ 11 ] It has reported a significantly lower cyclist fatality rate following the return to separated infrastructure. In the US, 58% of bicycle crashes involving injury, and 40% of crashes involving death occurred at intersections. [ 12 ] In 1972, UCLA published a report demonstrating awareness in the US of the protected intersection design. [ 13 ]", "lastUpdated": " This page was last edited on 30 June 2024, at 15:43"},

It is located in Linz , the capital of Upper Austria . It offers bachelor's, master's, diploma and doctoral degrees in business, engineering, law, science, social sciences and medicine. Today, about 24,000 [ 3 ] students study at the park campus in the northeast of Linz, with one out of nine students being from abroad. The university was the first in Austria to introduce an electronic student ID in 1998. The university is the home of the Johann Radon Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematics (RICAM) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. The JKU was established as the \"College of Social Sciences, Economics and Business\" ( Hochschule für Sozial- und Wirtschaftswissenschaften ) in 1966. The Faculty of Sciences and Engineering was established three years later and in 1975, the college was awarded university status and the Faculty of Law was integrated on campus. The university was named in honor of astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) who wrote his magnum opus harmonices mundi (\"The Harmony of the world\") in Linz during the early 17th century and taught mathematics at a school for the landed gentry ( Adelichen Landt-Schuelen ) near Linz. [ 4 ] At present, the campus added the \"JKU Science Park\", additional buildings for science and engineering institutes. In 2019 many new buildings are being built. JKU's campus is located in the northeast of Linz , in the Auhof area of the St. Magdalena district. The university buildings are placed in a 90-acre (364,000 m 2 ) park centered around a pond. The campus is accessible by the Linz tram lines 1 and 2 and the express bus line 77 . On weekdays, trams travel every 5 minutes and a trip to the city center ( Hauptplatz ) takes approximately 16 minutes. The JKU is also located close to Austria's autobahn network at the Dornach exit on the A7 Mühlkreisautobahn (ca. 1 km or 0.6 miles).  In anticipation of extending the campus, an additional autobahn exit, Auhof , is currently in the construction stages and is expected to better facilitate traffic, allowing a more direct route to the university. A bicycle path in the north-east corner of the town located along the north side of the Danube river provides direct access to the university and helps to reduce traffic in the area. Many larger dormitories are within walking distance of the university, such as the Julius Raab Heim , the WIST Haus , the Kepler Heim , the ESH and the KHG Heim . Several other dormitories are located in different parts of Linz, providing housing for more than 3,100 students in all of Linz. [ 5 ] Some of the dormitories become hotels during the summer holidays, most notably the Julius Raab Heim under the name Hotel Sommerhaus . The vice-chancellor and the Academic Senate are responsible for the university's management. There are several pro-vice-chancellors who are each assigned to specific task areas and who assist the vice-chancellor. The university board is an independent body that advises and counsels the vice-chancellor and the Academic Senate on management issues. Deans and faculty committees are responsible for management on a faculty level. Vice-chancellor and deans are elected for a 4-year period whereas faculty committees are elected for a 2-year period. [ 6 ] The Johannes Kepler University has four faculties with a total of 127 institutes. [ 7 ] The Faculty of Social Sciences, Economics and Business is the oldest and largest faculty in terms of students and graduates. The faculty consists of 32 institutes and offers academic degrees e.g. in Economics and Business Administration", "lastUpdated": " This page was last edited on 23 December 2024, at 11:09"},

A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number . For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1 , involve 5 itself. However, 4 is composite because it is a product (2 × 2) in which both numbers are smaller than 4. Primes are central in number theory because of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic : every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factorized as a product of primes that is unique up to their order. The property of being prime is called primality .

Founded in 1876 at New York University , the ACS currently has more than 155,000 members at all degree levels and in all fields of chemistry, chemical engineering , and related fields. It is one of the world's largest scientific societies by membership. [ 3 ] The ACS is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and holds a congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code . Its headquarters are located in Washington, D.C., and it has a large concentration of staff in Columbus, Ohio . The ACS is a leading source of scientific information through its peer-reviewed scientific journals, national conferences, and the Chemical Abstracts Service . Its publications division produces over 80 scholarly journals including the prestigious Journal of the American Chemical Society , as well as the weekly trade magazine Chemical & Engineering News . The ACS holds national meetings twice a year covering the complete field of chemistry and also holds smaller conferences concentrating on specific chemical fields or geographic regions. The primary source of income of the ACS is the Chemical Abstracts Service , a provider of chemical databases worldwide. The ACS has student chapters in virtually every major university in the United States and outside the United States as well. [ 4 ] These student chapters mainly focus on volunteering opportunities, career development, and the discussion of student and faculty research. [ 5 ] The organization also publishes textbooks, administers several national chemistry awards, provides grants for scientific research, and supports various educational and outreach activities. The ACS has been criticized for predatory pricing of its products ( SciFinder , journals and other publications), for opposing open access publishing, as well as for initiating numerous copyright enforcement litigations despite its non-profit status and its chartered commitment to dissemination of chemical information. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] In 1874, a group of American chemists gathered at the Joseph Priestley House to mark the 100th anniversary of Priestley's discovery of oxygen . Although there was an American scientific society at that time (the American Association for the Advancement of Science , founded in 1848), the growth of chemistry in the U.S. prompted those assembled to consider founding a new society that would focus more directly on theoretical and applied chemistry. Two years later, on April 6, 1876, during a meeting of chemists at the University of the City of New York (now New York University ) the American Chemical Society was founded. [ 8 ] The society received its charter of incorporation from the State of New York in 1877. [ 9 ] Charles F. Chandler , a professor of chemistry at Columbia University who was instrumental in organizing the society said that such a body would \"prove a powerful and healthy stimulus to original research, ... would awaken and develop much talent now wasting in isolation, ... [bring] members of the association into closer union, and ensure a better appreciation of our science and its students on the part of the general public.\" [ 8 ] Although Chandler was a likely choice to become the society's first president because of his role in organizing the society, New York University chemistry professor John William Draper was elected as the first president of the society because of his national reputation.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Facebook_features", "title": "List of Facebook features", "text": "Facebook is a social-network service website launched on February 4, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg . The following is a list of software and technology features that can be found on the Facebook website and mobile app and are available to users of the social media site. The news feed is the primary system through which users are exposed to content posted on the network. Using a secret method (initially known as EdgeRank ), Facebook selects a handful of updates to actually show users every time they visit their feed, out of an average of 1500 updates they can potentially receive. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] On September 6, 2006, Ruchi Sanghvi announced a new home page feature called News Feed. Originally, when users logged into Facebook, they were presented with a customizable version of their own profile. The new layout, by contrast, created an alternative home page in which users saw a constantly updated list of their friends' Facebook activity. News Feed highlights information that includes profile changes, upcoming events, and birthdays, among other updates. This has enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays to attract attention to their profile or cause. News Feed also shows conversations taking place between the walls of a user's friends. An integral part of the News Feed interface is the Mini Feed, a news stream on the user's profile page that shows updates about that user. Unlike in the News Feed, the user can delete events from the Mini Feed after they appear so that they are no longer visible to profile visitors. In 2011, Facebook updated the News Feed to show top stories and most recent stories in one feed, and the option to highlight stories to make them top stories, as well as to un-highlight stories. In response to users' criticism, Facebook later updated the News Feed to allow users to view recent stories first. Initially, the addition of the News Feed caused some discontent among Facebook users. Many users complained that the News Feed was too cluttered with excess information. Others were concerned that the News Feed made it too easy for other people to track activities like changes in relationship status, events, and conversations with other users. [ 3 ] This tracking is often casually referred to as \"Facebook-Stalking\". In response to this dissatisfaction, creator Mark Zuckerberg issued an apology for the site's failure to include appropriate customizable privacy features. Thereafter, users were able to control what types of information were shared automatically with friends. Currently, users may prevent friends from seeing updates about several types of especially private activities, although other events are not customizable in this way. With the introduction of the \"New Facebook\" in early February 2010 came a complete redesign of the pages, several new features and changes to News Feeds. On their personal Feeds (now integrated with Walls), users were given the option of removing updates from any application as well as choosing the size they show up on the page. Furthermore, the community feed (containing recent actions by the user's friends) contained options to instantly select whether to hear more or less about certain friends or applications. On March 7, 2013, Facebook announced a redesigned newsfeed. In 2022, Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms , announced it is renaming the \"News Feed\" to simply be named \"Feed\". [ 4 ] [ 5 ] \"Friending\" someone on the platform is the act of sending another user a \"friend request\" on Facebook. The two people are Facebook friends once the receiving party accepts the friend request. In addition to accepting the request, the user has the option of declining the friend request or hiding it using the \"Not Now\" feature. Deleting a friend request removes the request, but does allow the sender to resend it in the future. The \"Not Now\" feature hides the request but does not delete it, allowing the receiver to revisit the request at a later date. It is also possible to remove a user from one's friends, which is referred to as \"unfriending\" by Facebook. [ 6 ] Many Facebook users also refer to the process as \"de-friending\". [ 7 ] \"Unfriend\" was New Oxford American Dictionary 's word of the year in 2009. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Facebook does not notify a user if they have been unfriended, but there are scripts that provide this functionality. [ 10 ] There has also been a study on why Facebook users unfriend, which found that differences, especially between ages, and few mutual friendships were the dominant factors correlated with unfriending, all of which mirrors the decline of physical-world relationships. [ 11 ] Facebook profiles also have advanced privacy features to restrict content to certain users, such as non-friends or persons on a specific list. The wall is the original profile space where Facebook users' content was displayed, until December 2011. It allowed the posting of messages, often short or temporal notes, for the user to see while displaying the time and date the message was written. A user's wall is visible to anyone with the ability to see their full profile, and friends' wall posts appear in the user's News Feed. In July 2007, Facebook allowed users to post attachments to the wall, whereas previously the wall was limited to text only. [ 12 ] In May 2008, the Wall-to-Wall for each profile was limited to only 40 posts. Facebook later allowed users to insert HTML code in boxes attached to the wall via apps like Static FBML which has allowed marketers to track use of their fan pages with Google Analytics. The concept of tagging in status updates, an attempt to imitate Twitter, [ 13 ] began September 14, 2009. This meant putting the name of a user, a brand, an event or a group [ 14 ] in a post in such a way that it linked to the wall of the Facebook page being tagged, and made the post appear in news feeds for that page, as well as those of selected friends. [ 15 ] This was first done using the \"@\" symbol followed by the person's name. Later, a numerical ID for the person could be used. Visually, this was displayed with bold text. [ 16 ] Early in 2011, tagging in comments was added. In addition to postings by other users, the wall also displayed other events that happened to the user's profile. This included when information was changed, when they changed their profile picture, and when they connected with new people, among other things.

Due to the lack of mainstream news coverage on P2P topics, file sharing, and discussion of copyright legislation, Slyck had a significant impact as a news site: New Scientist cited Slyck as a \"popular file sharing news site\", [ 4 ] Digital Audio Essentials (2004) referred to Slyck as \"an excellent resource\" [ 5 ] for news and information on file sharing, and in Steal This Computer Book 4.0 (2006) the site was considered to be \"up to date on the latest file sharing technology and news\". [ 6 ] The website conducted interviews with file sharing software developers and intellectual property role players, maintaining statistics of P2P file sharing networks, and notably shed light on the developing conflict between file sharing users and intellectual property owners, which covered the legal battle against copyright and intellectual property infringement, such as the takedown of torrent websites like LokiTorrent [ 7 ] and Suprnova.org , [ 8 ] events that were covered in mainstream media from input by the intellectual property owners, which lacked the views of file sharing users which Slyck coverage aimed to represent. Notably, Slyck extensively covered BitTorrent website The Pirate Bay , and the efforts by Swedish and other national authorities to shut down and prosecute the founders and operators of The Pirate Bay. Slyck covered other news topics such as rollout of broadband Internet, new and emerging technologies, device hardware, and advances in computer networking. Slyck news writers were able to interview notable individuals such as: In March 2010, Slyck was threatened with legal action [ 20 ] by the controversial [ 21 ] [ 22 ] UK law firm ACS:Law for defamation, due to comments made by forum users on Slyck.com's UK file sharing Allegations/Lawsuit Discussion sub-forum. [ 23 ] Nothing came of the threatened legal action. By June 2016 Slyck had ceased publishing new news articles, with the last file-sharing news article being posted on 16 June 2016. [ 24 ] As of April 2020, Slyck is no longer accessible. [ 3 ] The final archival by the Wayback Machine is dated 8 March 2020.
